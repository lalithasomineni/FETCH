# NodeJs
## what is node.js?
 - "node is a runtime environment for executing js"
## what is the difference between node and browser? or why node?
 - previously before the existence of node every js code need to be run in browser.but after the evalution of node we can run it in many sources ,not only that node has extra features when compared with browser .
 ## how node works?
 - nodejs is asynchronous by default.
 
 -- every module is written in an immediately invoked function.
 
 ### classes 
 - a class is a method for a bunch of related methods and properties.
 ### classes in objects

- We know a constructor function is meant to be an object blueprint by the capitalization of the first letter of the initializer (which is optional) and through familiarity with the syntax. The class keyword communicates in a more straightforward fashion the objective of our function.

The only difference in the syntax of the initialization is using the class keyword instead of function, and assigning the properties inside a constructor() method.
```
    // Initializing a class definition
class Hero {
    constructor(name, level) {
        this.name = name;
        this.level = level;
    }

```
